# AutonomousTennisBot

The main code to run the robot is in the AutonomousTennis.py file.
To be able to run this the roboflow package needs to be installed and the users secret API key needs to be placed in order for the Vision model to run
Also, the pycreate2 module needs to be installed for controlling the robot.

We were able to run the script in a conda environment that had these packages installed.
